Analysis of Whatsapp conversations

Ideally, Facebook should have done this. But I used it as a real-life application of a big-data analysis tool I was developing. 
This tool analyzes your chats (currently, Whatsapp chats, but anybody can write a parser for other chatter apps like Skype, Hangout, Messenger etc and could be plugged in) to provide you with a ton of statistics, do sentiment analysis using smileys, text and message gaps, and also identify the general gist of discussion in a Whatsapp group (using LDA). 
Give it a shot - we respect your privacy and don't store any data. Honestly, I wanted to scrap data from Whatsapp's web-interface/app-interface but unfortunately, Whatsapp wouldn't let me do that even after the user authenticates it (Also, Whatsapp has NO API support (as of this writing) :-/) . So, at this point, got to take the long way and download chat files from Whatsapp and upload. 

Machine Learning part has a lot of algorithmic implementations that I hope to use in an upcoming summit, so not yet open-sourced.
